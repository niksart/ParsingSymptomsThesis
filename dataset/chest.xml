I've been having strange <symptom CUI="C0008031">chest pains</symptom> for the past month or so.
I felt <symptom CUI="C0235716">burning in the left side of my chest</symptom> that would not go away for about ten minutes.
For the next week or so, I began to have <symptom CUI="C0008031">chest pains</symptom> and also <symptom CUI="C0839476">pain in my upper arms</symptom>.

I have been getting more and more <symptom CUI="C0008031">sharp pain in my chest</symptom>, generally in the left side of my chest, over the last few months.
A few weeks ago I was rushed into hospital with <symptom CUI="C0008031">severe pains in chest</symptom> and <symptom CUI="C0004604">in the back</symptom> and <symptom CUI="C0027498">vomiting</symptom>.

I feel like I am being <symptom CUI="C0008301">choked inside throat</symptom>.
I was watching television and all of a sudden I had a <symptom CUI="C0008031">sharp jolting pain in my upper left part of my chest</symptom>.

About a month ago I noticed that my <symptom CUI="C0151315">neck was abnormally stiff</symptom> and my lung capacity seemed reduced somewhat.
My <symptom CUI="C0478661">neck seemed somewhat swollen</symptom> mostly on the lower right side though the left side may have been a little swollen to.
I was having some <symptom CUI="C0013456">mild pain behind my ears</symptom> and <symptom CUI="C0236000">in my jaw</symptom>.
Oddly enough, though I don't think it was related, <symptom CUI="C0850674">my left top eyelid was twitching uncontrollably </symptom>for 2 weeks leading up to me going to the doctor.
However, I had no other symptoms like a <symptom CUI="C0242429" NOT="YES">sore throat</symptom> or <symptom CUI="C0010200" NOT="YES">cough</symptom> that would suggest a cold.
I only have occassional <symptom CUI="C0013456">ear pain</symptom>.
I'm still having <symptom CUI="C0008031">discomfort that won't go away in my left chest area</symptom>.
